# Visualizing Employment Pathways using ONET Occupations

Build employment pathways using ONET occupations and tree strucutres. For any occupation, identify its 5 nearest neighoubring occupations - this will be the nodes of the first level of depth of the tree. Repeat this for each occupation node in the tree, up to 4 levels of depth. 

## Getting Started

Visualisation [HERE](https://uamarasinghe.github.io/employment-pathways.github.io/). At the bottom of the page, you'll find a dropdown where you can chose the occupation you want to build the employment pathway for. 

### Methodology

Nearest neighbouring occupations were identified by measuring the cosine similarity between 8 ONET attributes: skills, abilities, knowledge, interests, work activites, work styles, work context, and work values.
